# Installation
Woodwork Engine can be installed through `pip`:

```bash
pip install woodwork-engine
```

This gives access to the `woodwork` CLI tool.

# Setup
Create a main.ww file, populating it with some components. Consult the examples for some inspiration.

Run `woodwork init`, to install dependencies.

After installation is complete, run `woodwork` to activate the program.

# Next Steps
Now that you have mastered the setup process, I'd recommend checking out some tutorials, or equally reading about various components could be helpful.
